TODO:

In progress:
1. Regular expression builder
2. Lexer "API driver" code

Main tasks:
1. Regular expression builder
2. Lexer "API driver" code

Probably useful tasks:
1. Add graph searching algorithms to the Weighted digraph
   implementation
2. More unit tests (maybe automated ones?)
3. Graph comparison code (would make testing *much* better)
4. Make CMakeLists.txt more modular
5. Add support for regex syntactical sugar (shorthands)
