TODO:

Main tasks:
1. Implement NFA generation from a regular expression
2. Regular expression builder
3. Lexer "API driver" code

Probably useful tasks:
1. Add graph searching algorithms to the Weighted digraph
   implementation
2. More unit tests (maybe automated ones?)
3. Graph comparison code (would make testing *much* better)
4. Make CMakeLists.txt more modular
